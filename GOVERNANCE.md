> _A GOVERNANCE file lets people know about how your project is governed. For example, it might discuss project roles and how decisions are made_ ([Community health file: Supported file types](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file#about-default-community-health-files)).
